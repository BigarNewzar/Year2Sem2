Lab 8.4.1.3 Implementing VPNs

Step 3 part c - Verify the IKE policy with the show crypto isakmp policy command

R1#show crypto isakmp policy 



Step 4 Configure pre-shared keys

Q. Which IP addresses should you use to configure the IKE peers, given the topology diagram and IP addressing table? Why?
A.

Step 5 Configure the IPsec transform set and lifetime.

Q. What is the function of the IPsec transform set?
A.

Step 6 Define interesting traffic.
Q. Does IPsec evaluate whether the access lists are mirrored as a requirement to negotiate its security association?
A.

Task 2 : verify Site-toSite VPN

Enter show crypto ipsec transformation.
 R1#show crypto ipsec transform-set 


R3#sh crypto ipsec transform-set 


Show crypto map
R1#show crypto map


R3#sh crypto map 



Task 3: verify the IPsec VPN Operation

Display ISAKMP security associations

R1#sh crypto isakmp sa


R1# sh crypto ipsec sa



Q. Why haven't any SAs been formed?
A. 

Step 3.


R1#ping 10.2.2.1





R1#sh crypto isakmp sa




R1#ping 192.168.3.1




R1#sh crypto isakmp sa



Q was an SA created for thses pings?  Explain.
A.
  
Issue the debug ip ospf events

R1#debug ip ospf  events



Reissue the show crypto isakmp sa command

R1#sh crypto isakmp sa

Q. Was an SA created between R1 and R3? Explain
A.

Step 4: Generate some interesting traffic

Extended ping fromR1 to R3 G0/1 interface address 192.168.3.1

R1#ping


Reissue the show crypto iskakmp sa command

R1#sh crypto isakmp sa



Q. Why was an SA created between R1 and R3 this time?
A.

Q. What are the endpoints of hte IPsec VPN tunnel?
A.

Ping from PC-A to PC-C


C:\>ping 192.168.3.3



Q. How many packets have been tranformed between R1 and R3?
A. 

do a show crypto ipsec sa

R1#sh crypto ipsec sa



Q. The previous example used pings to generate interesting traffic.  What other types of traffic wolud result
in an SA forming and tunnel establishment?
A. 

REFLECTION

Q. Would traffic on the Gigabit Ethernet link between PC-A and the R1 F0/0 interface be encrypted by the 
site-to-site IPsec VPN tunnel? Explain.
A.
