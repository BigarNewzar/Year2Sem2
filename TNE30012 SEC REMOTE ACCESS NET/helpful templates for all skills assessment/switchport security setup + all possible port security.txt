//////for enabling portsecurity 
enable
conf t
int range <<range of interfaces that will have that port security>>
switchport port-security


(if only said port security then end it here. if it said a certain security then scroll down and find the specified command)

switchport port-security maximum <<max no of mac allowed to be set on that switch>>

if max mac address breached, then disable interface + inform admin via SNMP:
switchport port-security violation shutdown

if max mac address breached, then drop packets with unknown source address + inform admin via SNMP:
switchport port-security violation restrict

if max mac address breached, then behave like restrict but no admin informed via SNMP!:
switchport port-security violation protect


activate static mode switchport security
switchport port-security mac-address static

to add a static mac address manually to that port
mac address-table static  <<MAC address of the PC>> vlan <<Vlan ID>> interface <<interface ID>>

......................................................................



activate sticky mode switchport security (once mac learnt on port, its saved and not removed)
switchport port-security mac-address sticky

(for packet tracer, we will need to add switchport word at start for both static and sticky!)
switchport port-security mac-address sticky

or

switchport port-security mac-address static
mac address-table static  <<MAC address of the PC>> vlan <<Vlan ID>> interface <<interface ID>>

(will need to ping between pcs for testing this!)

To reactivate violated switch
enable
conf t
int <<Interface ID>>
shutdown
end
conf t
int <<INterface ID>>
no shutdown
end



to disable it, type " no " at the start and repeat the line.

to allocate specific mac address to that port: (still in that port's interface just like for the other above commands)
switchport port-security mac-address <<mac address>>

to test mac adfress table:
show mac address-table

to test port security for switch overall:
show port-security

to test port security for specific port/interface on switch:
show port-security int <<interface/port id>>

to test which port attached to secure ports on switch and status of secure ports
show port-security address
