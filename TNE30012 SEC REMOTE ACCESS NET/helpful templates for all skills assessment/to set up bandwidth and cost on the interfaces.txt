TO set up bandwidth or cost:


To set up Bandwidth:

enable
conf t
int <<interface ID>>
bandwidth <<value>>
end

(bandwidth values possible: 100000, 10000, 2048, 1544, 128, 64, 56)


(in show run, only cost will be show up! so will need to calculate the equivalent cost to that bandwidth to see if it matches)

10/(<<bandwidth>>*1000) = cost


to set up cost:

enable
conf t
int <<interface ID>>
cost <<value>>
end

(cost values possible: 1, 10, 48, 64, 781, 1562, 1785)

To test it:

sh run
(and see the value written as cost on that interface +( check for the equivalent cost for that bandwidth by calculating))
