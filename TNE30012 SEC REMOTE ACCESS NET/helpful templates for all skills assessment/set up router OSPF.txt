To set up OSPF on Routers:


enable
conf t
router ospf <<a process id from 1 to 65535>>
network <<ip address of that network>> <<wildcard>> area <<OSPF area id (usually its "0")>>
end


set up router id on OSPF:

enable
conf t
router ospf <<a process id from 1 to 65535>>
router-id <<ip address that you want to set as router ip>>
end

(otherwise, if loopbacks are set on it, the highest loopback will be used as router ID too)

(if no loopback at all, then the highest ip on it (that still has active interface) will be used as router iD)

(best case to force it to a certain value using those command sets)


To test it:

sh ip ospf neighbor
(brings up list with "neighbor IDs" and state as "FULL" )
(ones that dont have these means smth has gone wrong and ospf have not been set properly either on this router or on those routers preventing ospf communication from occuring)

sh ip protocols
(displays OSPF process ID, router ID, networks router is advertising & administrative distance)

sh ip ospf
(Displays OSPF process ID, router ID, OSPF area information & the last time SPF algorithm calculated)

sh ip ospf interface
(Displays hello interval and dead interval)
