To set up Lacp:
(if question dont say anything about "native vlan", skip that step)
(if question doesnt say pagp or lacp, do lacp!)

/////////for 1st switch:
enable
conf t
int range <<interface ID>>
switchport mode trunk

switchport trunk native vlan <<new vlan that will be native on this channel>>
//////skip this step unless question explicitly mentions to set a native vlan on that channel!

channel-group <<channel group id/ no>> mode active
no shutdown


///////////////for 2nd connected switch:
enable
conf t
int range <<interface ID>>
switchport mode trunk

switchport trunk native vlan <<new vlan that will be native on this channel>>
//////skip this step unless question explicitly mentions to set a native vlan on that channel!

channel-group <<channel group id/ no>> mode passive
no shutdown


/////////////for pagp, just change "active" "passive" into "desirable" "auto"  
(see if spelling,uing ok or not)


{for lacp, possible combination: active with active,  active with passive}
{for pagp, possible combination: desirable with desirable,  desirable with auto}
(never use on and on!!!!!! then although connection sets up, it doesnt use lacp or pagp!!!)

////////////to validate pagp and lacp

enable
sh etherchannel summary

(see if the channel is there or not, SU flag and P flags and also the mode is pagp or lacp respectively)
