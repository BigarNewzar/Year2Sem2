Information governance (INF30020 preferred)
---ISO 27014:2013 is the ISO 27000 series standard for 
Governance of Information Security
.....

- Process of governance in place to support the 
management and control an organisationâ€™s information 
assets and IT resources; broadly consisting of all types of 
information assets, information and communications 
systems as well as technology.

!!!!!!!!!!!!Convert this part to "Benefit it will have to etricity"!!!
- Increasingly important part of corporate governance 
because of:
	- organisational dependency on information and communications
	- scale of IT investments
	- potential for information resources and IT to create strategic 
	opportunities (.e.g through data analytics)
	- level of information/IT risk
	- regulatory and legal requirements
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

dumbed down version for etricity could be:

Good info governance assures that corruption is minimized, the views of minorities are considered and that the voices of the most vulnerable in society are heard in decision-making. It is also responsive to the present and future needs of society.
