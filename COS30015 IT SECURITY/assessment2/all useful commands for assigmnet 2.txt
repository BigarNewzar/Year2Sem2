Hi Karina,

I have noticed an email regarding Sessional Teching EOI for 2023. So, I was wondering if this was the application portal you were speaking about?

If so, there are a few areas in that application, where I would be glad to have your advice. So will it be possible to have a consultation with you regarding that next week or so, whenever you are free?


Things to ask Karina,
am i a sessional employee?
or HDR student and sessional employee?
   basically, what does swinburne hdr student mean?
   
Currently my highest qualification is completion of A levels (which is grade 12 completion) and currently i am doing bachelors but have not completed it yet
